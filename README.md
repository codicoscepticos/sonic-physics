# Sonic Physics

A prototype, implementing *Sonic the Hedgehog*'s physics engine, using GameMaker Studio,
following Sonic Retro's guide: http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide.
Also, using some data from [Sonic 1 Disassembly](https://github.com/sonicretro/s1disasm).

Made during August 2015. A great experience, especially about game development, which
reveals that developing games is more engineering than plain programming logic.
